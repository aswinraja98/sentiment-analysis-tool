## üéØ Problem Statement

In today's digital world, understanding the sentiment behind user reviews, comments, and messages is crucial for businesses and researchers. There's a growing need for automated systems that can:
- Accurately classify text as positive, negative, or neutral
- Work on real-world, noisy data
- Integrate easily with modern web applications

---

## üí° Solution

This project implements a **machine learning-based sentiment analysis system** using:

- **NLTK Movie Reviews Dataset** for training
- **Text preprocessing** with NLTK and pandas
- **Feature extraction** using scikit-learn's `CountVectorizer`
- **Naive Bayes classifier** (`MultinomialNB`) for robust predictions
- **Flask API** for serving predictions
- **Next.js/React** frontend for a beautiful, interactive demo

---

## Features
- Real sentiment classification using a trained machine learning model (Naive Bayes, NLTK movie reviews dataset)
- Modern, professional Next.js web interface (see `/web` folder)
- Live demo: input text and get instant predictions
- Easy integration into your portfolio website
- Well-documented, production-quality code

## Project Architecture

**Backend (Python):**
- Uses NLTK to load and preprocess the movie reviews dataset
- Vectorizes text with scikit-learn's `CountVectorizer`
- Trains a Naive Bayes classifier (`MultinomialNB`)
- Flask API (`api.py`) exposes a `/predict` endpoint for real-time predictions
- CORS enabled for frontend integration

**Frontend (Next.js):**
- Modern React UI for text input and displaying results
- Calls the Flask API for real sentiment predictions
- Styled for portfolio-quality presentation

---

## Installation & Usage

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aswinraja98/sentiment-analysis-tool.git
cd sentiment-analysis-tool
```

### 2. Install Python backend dependencies
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Start the Flask API
```bash
python api.py
# or, if using the venv:
.venv\Scripts\python.exe api.py
```

### 4. Install and run the Next.js frontend
```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 5. Open the demo
Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. Enter text and click "Analyze Sentiment" to see results.

## Example Output
```
Input: This movie was fantastic! I loved the acting and the story.
Result: positive

Input: Terrible film. Waste of time.
Result: negative

Input: It was okay, not great but not bad either.
Result: neutral
```

## Portfolio Integration

You can:
- Use the `/web/pages/index.js` as a standalone demo page in your portfolio
- Or, deploy the full project (backend + frontend) for a live interactive demo
- Customize styles, add your own branding, or extend the model as needed
